# Algorithms Challenge 1 - Shortest Path 
> Write a function that finds the shortest route between any two given cities. 
> Its argument is a pair of the cities' names and a map of the distances. 
> You can assume the cities' names are names and the distances are in km. 
> The function should return the pair of the route and the distance of the route. 
> Your function beave as the shortest_route function called below.
